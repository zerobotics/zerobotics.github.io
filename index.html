<p>One pill makes you larger, and one pill makes you small <br /> 
And the ones that mother gives you, don't do anything at all<br /> 
Go ask Alice, when she's ten feet tall<br /> 
And if you go chasing rabbits, and you know you're going to fall<br /> 
Tell 'em a hookah-smoking caterpillar has given you the call<br /> 
And call Alice, when she was just small<br /> 
When the men on the chessboard get up and tell you where to go<br /> 
And you've just had some kind of mushroom, and your mind is moving low<br /> 
Go ask Alice, I think she'll know<br /> 
When logic and proportion have fallen sloppy dead<br /> 
And the white knight is talking backwards<br /> 
And the red queen's off with her head<br /> 
Remember what the dormouse said<br /> 
Feed your head, feed your head ! </p>
